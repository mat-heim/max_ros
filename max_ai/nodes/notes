to do list
change self.chunkSequences in sa.py to sort into 5w1h catagories


using triples to store memory

subject
predicate a verb statement
object

q   what is a dog
SELECT o FROM triple WHERE p = 'is a' AND  s = 'dog';
A
 a dog is a canine

we could use tables to name predicates
and row for the data
table is_a
o     s
dog canine
SELECT s FROM is_a WHERE o = 'dog';
we can add more rows for extra data



tables
is_in
is_on
is person
has_name

from patern we neeed to sort text into 5w1h
What
What, specifically,...?
What next?
What else?
Where
Where else?
Where are you?
Where, exactly...?
When
When, exactly, will you...?
When will it start/end?
When will I know?
Why
Why does that happen?
Why not?
(just keep asking 'why?' to find root cause - often around 5 times)
How
How many?
How much?
How does it work?
Who
Who will do this?
Who else will do this?
Who pays?
Who benefits?

cursor = conn.execute("SELECT s  from is_a WHERE O =' '")
for row in cursor:
   print "ID = ", row[0]
   print "NAME = ", row[1]
   print "ADDRESS = ", row[2]
   print "SALARY = ", row[3], "\n"





so far we can /have
location statements
where is questions
in, on 

not is
not all words a correctly recognised 
peter is a verb
bonn is a adj

main key is ID
2nd key is concept ie  cat dog
3rd key is descriptive  ie blue zoe forms part of concept to make concept cat blue??????????????
4 th key is location ie mat xyz
5 key is 

last key is properties ie age: is a dictionary

 how to link to ontology??????????

add memory 

no concept found
we have cat not cat blue
or cat zoe

update a memory

concept found but statement is false
ie memory is cat on the mat
new statement is cat is on the roof
