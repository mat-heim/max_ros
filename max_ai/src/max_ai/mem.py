# nlpx memory class. This class provides the CCSR NLP module with a concept-based memory. A concept
# is extracted from an input sentence: e.g. 'the cat is very yellow' -> concept='cat', and
# the memory stores information about this concept, e.g. state='very yellow'
# Currently CCSR memory stores state, locality and properties.

# CCSR has a concept 'I', which contains information about itself. In the future, CCSR state such
# as battery level, location etc will be dumped from the CCSR process (by telemetry), and voice input can
# query these properties: e.g. 'what is your battery level'
